<p id="ord">Watching movies is a part of almost everyoneâ€™s life. They entertain us, teach us lessons, and even help us socialize by giving us topics to talk about with others. As long as movies have been produced, everyone has patronized them. 

  Cinema is an art form in itself. The lighting, camera work, and acting in the most widely-acclaimed movies are worthy of praise. Furthermore, a movie can be used to send a message, often discussing issues in contemporary society. Movies are entertaining, but more importantly, they are works of art. </p><br>
